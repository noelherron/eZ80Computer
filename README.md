# eZ80Computer

This is a single board computer based on the Zilog eZ80 microcontroller.

The eZ80 was chosen because it is an interesting microcontroller with a deep history.

It's CPU is based on the Z80, which was very popular in the 1980s, and is still manufactured today.

The eZ80 is distinct from many other microcontrollers because it has an exposed address and data bus.

Most microcontrollers have built in memory and omit these pins.

This means we can design our own memory scheme, and learn about things like bus mastering.

Like a traditional microcontroller, it still has many built in periferals, which keeps things small and simple.

This is a learning project for me to better understand electronics, PCB design, and computer system design.

I have already spent many hours in KiCad and had a batch of prototypes made.
